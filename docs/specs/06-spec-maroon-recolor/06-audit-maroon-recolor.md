## Executive Summary

- Overall Status: **PASS**
- Required Gate Failures: **0**
- Flagged Risks: **2**

All four REQUIRED gates pass on the first run. Two non-blocking FLAG findings are
recorded below for the implementer's awareness.

## Gateboard

| Gate | Status | Note (<=10 words) | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirement-to-test traceability | PASS | Every FR → task + grep/test artifact | `## Tasks 1.0, 2.0` |
| Proof artifact verifiability | PASS | Concrete grep/diff/test/screenshot; no vague language | proof sections |
| Repository standards consistency | PASS | 5 sources read; no conflicts | table below |
| Open question resolution | PASS | Spec has none; handoff-missing → assumption | see FLAG 2 |
| Regression-risk blind spots | FLAG | Contrast + `#fff` grep ordering | FLAG 1 |
| Non-goal leakage | PASS | 6 tokens + `.tsx` explicitly excluded | `1.1, 2.1` |

## Standards Evidence Table

| Source File | Read | Standards Extracted | Conflicts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | yes | Strict TDD for backend domain only; frontend view plumbing lightly tested; conventional commits | none |
| `docs/TESTING.md` | yes | Frontend view plumbing = light; pure recolor needs no new tests, only suite green | none |
| `README.md` (root) | yes | Token-driven UI; Vite dev flow | none |
| `frontend/package.json` | yes | Test = `vitest` (`npm test -- --run`); lint = `eslint .` | none |
| `06-spec-maroon-recolor.md` | yes | 7 token replacements + `--on-accent`; theme-color meta; defer 6 tokens to #20 | none |

## Requirement → Task → Test-Artifact Traceability

| Functional Requirement | Task(s) | Test/Verification Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Replace 7 `:root` base tokens | 1.1 | grep (old=0 matches, new=7 matches) |
| Leave `--danger*` + non-color tokens unchanged | 1.1, 1.3 | `git diff` scoped to value lines |
| Update `theme-color` meta → `#F3ECDD` | 1.2 | grep `theme-color` in `index.html` |
| No component markup/class/behavior change | 1.3 | `git diff` (no `.tsx` touched) |
| Add `--on-accent: #f6ecd9` | 2.1 | grep `--on-accent` definition |
| Tokenize `color: #fff` → `var(--on-accent)` | 2.2 | grep no bare `#fff`; grep usage |
| Do not add the 6 stylist-only tokens | 2.1, 2.3 | grep (6 tokens = 0 matches) |
| Behavior unchanged / suite green | 2.4 | `npm test -- --run` all pass, no test edits |

## Findings

### FLAG Findings

1. **Regression coverage is verification-only + `#fff` grep depends on task order.**
   - Risk (a): WCAG AA contrast (Success Metric 5) is asserted in the spec but not
     measured by any planned automated check — verification is visual/manual via
     screenshots. Acceptable for a fixed handoff palette, but there is no
     regression guard if a future token edit breaks contrast.
   - Risk (b): the `grep -n "#fff"` check in 2.3 is only clean **after** task 1.1
     replaces `--paper-raised: #fffefb` (which contains the substring `fff`). If an
     implementer runs the 2.3 grep before completing 1.1, it will report a false
     positive on `#fffefb`.
   - Suggested remediation: keep the parent order (1.0 fully before 2.0); optionally
     note in 2.3 that the `#fff` grep presumes 1.1 is done. No spec/task blocker.

2. **`design_handoff_stylist_maroon/` is not present in the repo.**
   - Risk: task 2.1 says the `--on-accent` comment should match "the handoff's
     `theme-tokens.css`", but that file is absent locally.
   - Resolution / assumption: the spec captures every hex value (7 tokens +
     `--on-accent: #f6ecd9`) and the contrast rule inline, so the plan is fully
     self-contained. The comment text is cosmetic; task 2.1 supplies an explicit
     fallback comment (`/* cream text/icons on maroon fill */`). Standards
     confidence for values: **high** (fixed in spec); for the handoff file itself:
     **low** (external, not vendored). Not a REQUIRED failure.

## Chain-of-Verification

- Self-question — "Do all REQUIRED gates pass with explicit evidence?" → Yes;
  each REQUIRED gate has a concrete reference in the tables above.
- Fact-check — verified against live code: cobalt values at `index.css:10-16`
  match the old-value grep; `color: #fff` at `index.css:169`; `theme-color
  #F7F5F0` at `index.html:6`; runner is `vitest`; 10 test files exist.
- Inconsistency resolution — the two FLAGs are advisory, not REQUIRED gaps; both
  carry an explicit assumption/remediation and neither blocks handoff.
- Final synthesis — **Overall Status PASS; 0 REQUIRED failures; ready for the
  implementation phase.**
